The $G$ functional from \cite{MR3066400}, gives a weighted volume. Is there a viscosity equation and/or comparison theory? The Gaussian, i.e. Huisken density should be optimal!

Space-time singularities of curvature flows
Also look up Ben Chow's book on Ricci flow. There he discusses solitions as fixed points up to diffeomorphism. This should give the correct idea of what a soliton should be. Namely, there should be a notion of gradient solition just as for Ricci-flow, where the isometries are generated by the flow of a vector field. I think in this case, any conformal vector field along with the appropriate time change should give rise to such a soliton.

Solitons <-> minimal space-time sub-manifolds w.r.t. warped product

In other words, \(\grad f\)-soliton, correspond to critical points in the warped product manifold of the volume functional. CMC-surfaces are then critical points with Lagrange multiplies, i.e. critical points of the volume plus a constant (the mean curvature) times the area. Do they correspond to any solution of MCF?

- All the compactness is there!
- Use chord/arc profile
- local asymptotics may be similar to Euclidean, but I guess dependent also on curvature
