This is the map along the normal direction to a hypersurface. The cut point is where the map hits another point on the surface.

Given $M\subset N$ a cooriented hypersurface with normal vector $\nor$, define the cooriented (oriented?) curvature tangent ball at $p$ to be the largest ball tangent to $M$ with center in the direction $\nor$. Now do variations to find a viscosity equation for the curvature.
