Especially in connection with isoperimetric estimates!
All that is needed is a bound on the isoperimetric constant to guarantee long time existence.
Furthermore, it is connected with Maxwell's equations, U(1) bundles and the like!

- Harnack quadratic evolution has curvature and derivatives of curvature in it
- Constant, positive, sectional curvature should be okay since derivatives vanish and positivity gives the correct sign
- Symmetric spaces also have \nabla Rm = 0
- In general we just get a bunch of stuff involving Rm and \nabla Rm and we want it to be positive
  - Compute this stuff!
  - Investigate what it means for it to be positive
- Can we modify the Harnack as we did in the sphere to get something that works better?
- Can we modify the Harnack so that all we need is bounds on the extra stuff? A bit like Ben Chow $\S^2$ Ricci flow paper
- Integral Harnack inequality
- Consequences such as convergence results, ancient solutions etc.
- Hamilton's thm on if an ancient solution achieves a space-time maximum it must be a translatig soliton 
  - Does this hold in Riemannian backgrounds? that is, do we get an identity that must be satisfied by such a solition?
  - Must it move by the flow of a Killing field? Then, we get uniqueness, but in general not existence of such solitons.

- Definitely look into iso profile of solitons via exhaustion function
- Can we add a time dependent function to the Harnack quadratic like Ben Chow sphere Ricci flow paper? E.g. instead of Q = $\partial_t \ln f$, use $Q = \partial_t \ln f + q(t)$ and find out if there is a useful ODE for $q(t)$ that makes it all work - for example, the Harnack computation will have a bunch of curvature terms in the "remainder". Can we choose q to cancel these so that the max principle can be applied?

In the Nomizu-Sasaki book, they study Blaschke hypersurfaces which come from affine immersions with some assumption about the area measure. Is the flow approach useful to study these problems?

- Hamilton messes about with o/n frames via connection on the frame bundle (horizontal sub-bundle) and does an Uhlenbeck trick by differentating w.r.t. to an adjusted time vector which preserves o/n frames. We reparametrise the flow instead and introduce $\D_t$ which should have an intrinsic interpretation: Is the connection 
  \[
  \D_X Y = \nabla^t_X Y, \D_t \partial_t = 0, \D_t X = - A(X) = D_X \xi
  \]
  the Levi-Civita connection for $g = g_t + dt^2$?

  So our approach involves reparametrising the flow and using the appropriate connection along this reparametrisation.
- Ben Chow mentions that the scalar Harnack inequality does not directly follow by applying the maximum principle to his scalar evolution, because there are terms whose very definition relies on the matrix Harnack inequality. Does our method avoid this difficulty and allow us to directly obtain the scalar Harnack without having to go via this rather complicated Hamilton/Chow approach which becomes computationally very intensive.
- What about solitons? They move by the Lie derivative of a vector field. Our reparametrisation uses the Lie derivative of a vector field.  \[
  \partial_t g = -2 X + \lie_{\xi} g
  \]
  Can it be that solitons are static under this reparametrisation? Probably not, but there could be some connection between these Lie derivative terms? What if a solution moves by this particular Lie derivative? Does that make sense?
- We say that $\D_t \nu = 0$, $\D_t g = 0$. So intrinsically, we have $\D_t g = 0$ under our parametrisation. We can maybe also interpret the $\D_t \nu = 0$ identity as giving a product structure $M \times (-\epsilon, \epsilon)$ from something like,
  \[
  (x, t) \in M \times (-\epsilon, \epsilon) \mapsto \exp_{F(x)} (t\xi(x)).
  \]
  This is the motivation for the guess that the above connection is the Levi-Civita connection for the product metric. Does this need $\D_{\xi} \xi = 0$?
