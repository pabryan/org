I need to be able to focus on the right tasks which means not seeing all possible tasks that I may do eventually!

- Research agenda view
  - day to day: only show working and not future tasks
  - high level planning: show projects and not individual tasks
  - projects: restrict to a project 
- Teaching agenda view
  - Shows teaching tasks and so forth
- General agenda view
  - Pretty much what I have now (maybe I don't need tasks listed)
- Personal agenda view
  - Non-work stuff

It would be nice to narrow to a project and have it display sub-projects in an easy to browse manner
