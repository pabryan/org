- start an open notebook
- contact collaborators and see if I can put our work in it
- I'll definitely write using org-mode (even wikis with markdown from org)
- perhaps my work can be on google+, facebook, wordpress whatever and pulled in to my website or vice versa!

- put all ext stuff in working/external. no separate github, bitbucket dirs
- create symlink set up script. creates Dropbox/$HOSTNAME/org etc. plus Dropbox/publish etc.
- generate a list of repos and their remote urls into a file
- put scripts and files in it's own repo
- check uncomitted uses repo list

Maybe I could have a links file that is ignored in _config.yml (so it's not published) that has some links to create post-deploy (e.g. math20d -> math20d_summer2_2013)

- Some obvious ones like emacs probably don't matter.
- org-mode is important and obvious. It looks like org works even without this package installed, so I probably should have it in the list to avoid confusion.
- jekyll, ruby, rubygems
- hg-autosync
