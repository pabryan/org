- Clone selected papers
- Use overflow code for up/down voting, badges, reputation etc.. Google+ has +1. Where does the data get stored?
- It would also be nice to have profile pages. This can just be Google+, but we might want to pull in some extra data too.
- Make an overlay reference implementation. Use if for my publications on my website! This should get data from ArXiv and Sel. Papers and present it on any web page.
- How do we link directly (say from my webpage) to a Selected Papers paper with discussion?

- Harnack ineq to prove ancient soln's are concave -> classification?
- dist comp on surfaces
- iso comp on surfaces
- iso comp for MCF. Maybe I can give the comparison inequality, but only find barriers for convex hypersurfaces? Try high codim!
- change vars $(x, t) \to (y(x,t), s(t))$ so that ancient solutions are similarity solns
- Isoperimetric comparison with respect to Huisken's density (weighted Levy/Gromov perhaps?). How does this relate also to minimal surfaces?

Like special blocks, but for headlines with a *semantic* property like class/type (already have ID) which exports in HTML to a div with that class or to an environment in LaTeX.

Each week I need to
- Read some papers
- Try out some ideas
- Work on projects with definite next tasks, like write up such and such. Calculate such and such.
- Do teaching

Can I assign times to do this, or do I just do whatever's appropriate for where I am?
* TODO Do I make a different TODO keyword for more trying out things/open ended type research?
