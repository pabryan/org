Title: The Curvature Estimate Of Higher Codimensional Mean Curvature Flow

Abstract: K. Ecker and G. Huisken have derived a priori estimate for the
curvature (second fundamental forms) when they study the mean curvature
flow of the graph of a function in Euclidean space. In this talk, I will explain
that a similar curvature estimate also exists for higher codimensional mean
curvature flow under certain natural conditions. This is joint work with
Knut Smoczyk and Mu-Tao Wang.
