- This is the map along the normal direction to a hypersurface. The cut point is where the map hits another point on the surface.
- How does this relate to cohomology of the normal bundle, the Poincare dual, and the Thom isomorphism. How does this cohomology evolve?

Given $M\subset N$ a cooriented hypersurface with normal vector $\nor$, define the cooriented (oriented?) curvature tangent ball at $p$ to be the largest ball tangent to $M$ with center in the direction $\nor$. Now do variations to find a viscosity equation for the curvature.

** Chemical X
Combustrum, aether, dark matter, vitamin X etc. are all examples of where people have postulated exotic unknown substances to explain poorly understood phemomena. Survey the history and give contemperary examples along with some reasons why we do this (anthropological?) 

** Cause and Effect
What is it? How do we get a handle on it? How do we reduce it from say the cause of an effect was everything in the backwards light cone (i.e. the state of the system at all times prior)?
