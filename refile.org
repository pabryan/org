I need to separately create the master since otherwise it hangs. Probably I'll need to do this either as a daemon or at the beginning of check_working scripts and then just shut it down at the end. Otherwise, I don't really need a persistent connection to bitbucket (it does save a lot of time for check_uncommited!)
