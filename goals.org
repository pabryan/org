** Weekly time
I want something like 20-30 hours formal work. Includes
- teaching
- university admin (ordering text books, printing, emailing students, setting up Ted, etc.)
- journal work
- grants/jobs (writing research statement, updating cv, job apps etc.)
- math writing (papers, books, articles, blogs, talks, etc.)
- organisation (daily/weekly reviews, planning etc.) Maybe I should schedule specific writing.
- research collation. Collect my scribbles from the week and organise them, and create writing tasks to type up results/important things.

Then during the week, I want to spend 1-2 hrs/day with paper/pen research. Just compute like crazy, no restriction, no organisation needed!
  
** Weekly writing
Do I want to write at least say 15 hrs a week? If so, plan it out, commit and go! I've scheduled time for exercise and teaching, so do it for writing too! The plan should be incremental and guaranteed to succeed. See [[http://paidtoexist.com/creative-battle/]] for some pointers.
