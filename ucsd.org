To all Instructional Faculty and TAs for Fall 2012 (please note the correctly working links to office hour information);

It's that time of the quarter when we ask you to submit office hours to the front desk.  We are continuing with our on-line submission form that interacts with the departmental webpages, listing office hours at either
http://math.ucsd.edu/people/office-hours-instructors/
for Faculty
or
http://math.ucsd.edu/people/office-hours-tas/
for TAs


To submit your office hours:

  1. Go to web site: http://mathlink.ucsd.edu/

  2. Enter YOUR Euclid username and password and click on the login button

  3. Click the Office Hours icon

  4. A list with all your Fall 2012 courses will be presented

  5. Select one of the courses by pressing 'Edit'

  6. Fill out the days and hours for your primary office hours and any additional office hours you will be holding for each course.

  7. Logout when finished

If you have difficulties with the system, please feel free to email me your hours - along with any suggestions for improving the submission system.

Thank you,
Scott
