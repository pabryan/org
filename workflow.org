** TODO Process for Learning 
If I want to learn something, e.g. some maths or self-improvement, juggling, etc., make a project for this in org-mode where I can store notes. It would be really nice to be able to put a bookmark in a pdf/ebook and create a link in org-mode to that bookmark.

Archive the lot! Organise into folders/tags whatever. gmail can be the main repository to sync with, but as with org files, maybe have machine specific syncing to dropbox also.

** TODO Dropbox and vcs
Use dropbox just to mirror static files: can sync between multiple computers
For dynamic files, auto sync to vc every hour or so and sync with dropbox, but to a machine specific folder, e.g. org-office, org-home. These should be seperate directories so I don't get clashes. This is just for backup purposes. The synchronisation should be via bitbucket.

** TODO Get snacks for office
I should get a plunger and coffee to save money though milk is problematic then! I could bring it daily in a thermos.

Also could have dry snacks, tinned stuff like sardines and so on.
