** TODO Dropbox and vcs
Use dropbox just to mirror static files: can sync between multiple computers
For dynamic files, auto sync to vc every hour or so and sync with dropbox, but to a machine specific folder, e.g. org-office, org-home. These should be seperate directories so I don't get clashes. This is just for backup purposes. The synchronisation should be via bitbucket.
