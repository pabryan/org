**** Review
Review Form

Place an 'X' next to a statement.

The paper:

----- is acceptable

----- needs revision

X---- should be rejected

Unfortunately, I think the paper should be rejected since the main result is essentially vacuous. What's more, the author seeks to find cases where $d/l$ is increasing for space curves. In general, we do not expect this to be true; embedded space curves can cross, at which point $d/l$ is $0$ and hence must have been decreasing at some point. The author does not give any conditions for when we might expect $d/l$ to be increasing, except for the obvious vaccuous condition:

In the paper, the computation in $\RR^3$ is much the same as Huisken's computation in $\RR^2$ on which the paper is based. This is a computation of the evolution of the ratio $d/l$ under the curve shortening flow where $d$ is the extrinsic distance in $\RR^3$ and $l$ the intrinsic distance on the curve. The computation gives, at minima $(p_0, q_0)$ of $d/l$ at time $t_0$,
\[
\frac{d}{dt} (d/l) \geq -|e_1+e_2|^2 +\langle e_1+e_2, w\rangle + \frac{d^2}{l^2} \left(\int_{\gamma_{t_0}} k ds_{t_0}\right)^2
\]
precisely as in Huisken's paper where $e_1,e_2$ are the unit tangents at $p_0$ and $q_0$ respectively and $w$ is the unit vector pointing from $p_0$ to $q_0$. The main theorem is then simply that if this is positive, then $d/l$ is increasing at $(p_0,q_0)$ at time $t_0$. As I say, a vaccuous statment.

In $2$ dimensions ($<w,e_1+e_2>$ and $|e_1+e_2|^2$) cancel and the result follows. In $3$ dimensions this no longer generally true and what's more, by Cauchy-Schwartz, these terms are negative. So $d/l$ will be positive precisely when the integral of curvature term dominates these two. The author does not give any indication of when this may or may not be true, nor say for instance that if it's true at time $t_0$ then it's true for $t>t_0$ which I think could be a useful result, but it's almost certainly not true!

Another part of the paper is devoted to studying the helix. The author shows, by direct computation and the assitance of matalb that when the pitch of the helix is small, the right hand side above is negative and that when it is sufficiently large it is positive. Thus there are cases where distance comparison may fail, but we already knew that. This is routine, elementary calculation and not suitable for publication in a research journal (unless the paper had something else worthwhile). In any event, the author shows that $d/l$ always increases for the helix (we discarded some terms in the inequality above), which again is by elementary, routine calculation.

The last two pages contain an interesting, rather simple result. That is, that space curves initially lying on the unit sphere, remain on the sphere of radius $\sqrt{t}$. By rescaling so that the curve remains on the unit sphere, and after suitably rescaling time, one obtains a solution of curve shortening flow on the sphere. This is quite simple to derive and although I was unaware of this result, it must surely be known as simple as it is. The author goes on to conlude a Grayson-type theorem, that the curve in $\RR^3$ collapses to a round point. The proof is by using the result for curves on $S^2$ that they either collapse to a round point or approach a geodesic (which is of course round). The problem here is that the author doesn't discuss whether the shrinking sphere can collapse before the corresponding curve on $S^2$ converges, which would mean that the space collapses to a non-round point. I think this is probably simple enough, but no mention of this possibility is made.

In any event, this latter result takes only 2 pages and is quite straightforward, again not publishable on it's own. However, personally I think this latter result has the most merit and could lead to some interesting research. I indicate a few quick thoughts in my comments for the author.


**** Comments for the author
The main theorems concerning $d/l$ improving at a minima are not particularly useful given they are essentially vaccuous. Theorem 2.2 for instance simply follows the same computation as Huisken's but in your case the required terms don't cancel, and by Cauchy-Schwartz are in fact negative when non-zero. Just stating that if they are positive then $d/l$ improves is not particularly useful, and I say is essentially vaccuous.

If you could modify $Z=d/l$ by adding some terms to obtain something that does improve, then perhaps this could be useful Keep in  mind, that having some quantity $Z$ improving is in itself not interesting. It is what you can then do with this that is important, e.g. by proving the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson theorem. With this in mind, I don't think your approach will produce any useful results because in general we know $d/l$ will not improve (for example by losing embeddedness) and because singularities can arise. These situations must somehow be handled or ruled out of consideration. There are however, perhaps some interesting questions in this direction: 

1. By comparing with some suitable comparison solution/function that you do understand, can you obtain results like the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson theorem or the Abresch-Langer classification of limiting shapes? Note again that such a theorem must be able to handle all the known phenoma of CSF for space curves. 

2. Alternatively, such a theorem could apply to a restricted class of space curves; for instance, it does apply to plane curves by Huisken's result. So, can you find an interesting class of curves for which the terms in Thm 2.2 are non-negative? For instance, does a bound on $\kappa/\tor$ (like in the Helix case) lead to improvement of $d/l$?

If you could answer question 2, then the helix example may be good to include in a future paper as illustation of this type of behaviour. On it's own, while an interesting example, it is not suitable for a research paper.

I did find the correspondence between spatial CSF starting on a sphere with CSF on the sphere interesting. I have a question about concluding a Gage-Hamilton-Grayson type result for this situation: could the shrinking sphere collapse before the corresponding flow on the unit sphere converges to a point/geodesic? If that happens, then you won't get a round point. 

The result for curves on spheres, though interesting, is probably not suitable for research publication. It is quite straightforward to prove and doesn't use any new techniques. Something that may be interesting would be to use the correspondence to study CSF on $S^2$ itself. Can you use the correspondence for instance, to prove the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson theorem on $S^2$? Can you use distance comparison in this case?

In another direction, suppose you have a family of surfaces in $\RR^3$ flowing by mean curvature flow (or some other geometric flow) and take a family of curves lying on the surface. These evolve along with the family of surfaces. Can you add a part tangential to the surface, but normal to the curve to obtain any useful geometric flow? Can you conclude anything useful about curve flows on surfaces from this point of view? Or, can you conclude anything useful about mean curvature flow of surfaces using the curve flow? What happens in higher dimensions?

***** Notes
****** Flow
In hyperbolic space flow by $(K-1)\nor$. How about in $M(\kappa)$, flow by $(K-\kappa)\nor$ where $M(\kappa)$ is the simply connected space form with constant curvature $\kappa$?

****** Support Function
******* Definition
Define
\[
s_{\kappa} (x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\kappa} \sin \kappa x, & \kappa > 0 \\
x, & \kappa = 0 \\
\frac{1}{\abs{\kappa}} \sinh \abs{\kappa} x, & \kappa < 0
\end{cases}
\]
and 
\[
V_{\kappa} (x) = s_{\kappa} (d) \grad d
\]
from which we define the support function
\[
s_{\kappa}(x) = \ip{\nor(x)}{V_{\kappa} (x)}
\]
of an immersed hypersurface $F: M \to M(\kappa)$, for $x\in M$.

The support function defined this way is the orthogonal distance from the origin to the totally geodesic hypersurface tangent to $M$ at $x$. In $\RR^{n+1}$, this is just the tangent plane to $M$ at $x$ embedded as an affine subspace in $\RR^{n+1}$.  For $\HH^{n+1}$, I think the totally geodesic submanifold might be identifiable with the tangent plane and the origin is any point - usually take $\HH^{n+1}$ to be the one-sheeted hyperboloid in Minkowski space $\RR^{n+1,1}$ and the origin to be the point $(0, \dotsc, 0, 1)$. For $\sphere^{n+1}$ of course, the tangent plane is non-compact and so can't be embedded in $\sphere^{n+1}$, but I think you can map the tangent plane onto the totally geodesic hypersurface. Then the tangent plane is the universal cover of the totally geodesic hypersurface. The origin is any point which we usually take to be the north pole.

In all cases, $\sphere^n$ can be embedded "canonically" as the set of points distance $1$ from the origin - do we have to be careful in $\HH^{n+1}$? In $\RR^{n+1}$ this is the usual embedding, in $\sphere^{n+1}$ it is the equator and in $\HH^{n+1}$ it I think is the "equator" given by intersecting the hyperboloid with a hyperplane $x_{n+2} = c$ in $\RR^{n+1,1}$.

All of this says that the situation described in Ben Andrew's harnack inequality for evolving hypersurfaces paper should carry through. For instance, we can parametrise the image of $M$ by the Gauss map. Then the support function parametrisation is
\[
\phi(z) = \exp (s(z) z) + \exp(a(z))
\]
for $z\in\sphere^n$ and where $a(z)$ is tangent. Is the tangent plane at $x$ parallel to the tangent plane to $\sphere^n$ in hyperoblic space and in the sphere? If so then we should be able to conclude something like $a(z) = \grad s$ just as Ben does in Euclidean space.

******* Laplacian
We compute $\laplace s$ in the standard parametrisation (i.e. $s$ is a function on $M$ not on $\sphere^n$) which I think is something like
\[
\laplace s = \ip{\laplace V}{\nor} + \ip{V}{\conx \meancurv} + \text{Tr} (X, Y \mapsto \ip{\conx_X \nor}{\conx_Y V} + \ip{\conx_Y \nor}{\conx_X V}).
\]
The last term is related to the Lie derivative of the metric with respect to $V$ and should behave nicely for this choice of $V$. I don't know how exactly yet. This formula gives some sort of Bochner formula for $s$.

We could also do it via the Gauss map parametrisation as Ben does. I think in the sphere and hyperbolic space this won't be quite as nice as Euclidean space, but may be nicer than the standard parametrisation.

I think it probably is not necessary, even in Euclidean space to use the Gauss map parametrisation, though is does mean we need to deal with a time dependent metric. Recall Ben is able to write everything with respect to the fixed metric on $\sphere^n$ which simplifies matters greatly. Even still, in the standard parametrisation, the computation should be substantially simpler than Hamilton's Harnack inequality. 

******* Generalisations
The following is for after we figure out the simply connected space form situation.

I think all the above can be generalised to Lie groups with bi-invariant metric (maybe just left-invariant) and maybe quotients of such Lie groups. Also Killing parallelisable manifolds should be amenable to these techniques and perhaps all we need is manifolds admitting a Killing field. Also, in these cases, I don't think we could use the Gauss map parametrisation so easily and the standard parametrisation may be preferrable. In this situation however, we may make use of the Bochner formula for the support function. In particular, if $V$ is a Killing field (which can be obtained for Lie groups with bi-invariant metrics by left translation of any vector field), the last term in $\laplace s$ above vanishes. 

****** Questions
******* Gauss map paramertisations
Can we parametrise convex hypersurfaces using the Gauss map? Do we need to?
******* Harnack Inequality
Can we get a Harnack inequality from the support function?
******* Long time behaviour
Can we deduce long-time behaviour from the support function?

This should just involve extra terms from the potential. These should give the Bakry-Emery tensor where the usual one has just the Ricci tensor. Our assumption is a bound on Bakry-Emery so it should be very similar. Do we compare with the sphere again, or some weighted model that satisfies equality. It would be good to know what the solutions are!

This should open pdf's, get doi info and then look up the paper details
online to get bib type info. Then the paper can be renamed, a bib entry
can be created or downloaded, say from mathscinet or arxiv. I'd aso like this
to create an org-mode headline for my refs.org file. I don't want to do this
manually, though a bit of elisp should be able to iterate over each bib
entry (using reftex?) and update the refs.org file. I may also want to store
each bib entry in a seperate file and have refs.bib a concatenation of the lot
so that I don't have problems editing refs.bib from multiple places.

I could also have author, title, date etc. in the properties drawer! This is redundant, but means I can search my org file on author etc.
No! Maybe I can use reftex and get it to take me to the entry in refs.org? I can certainly due this manually, using reftex to take me to the bib file which gives the ID which I can search for in the org file. Then I don't need to maintain duplicate info in the org and bib files and have all the power of reftex available.
I'd like to be able to use org-mode views to show papers/books by a given author or by subject. Maybe I can have some sort of hook that uses reftex to do the search and return a list of ID's which is then the filter for org-mode views.

*** Distance viscosity and evolution equations and curvature
With a viscosity equation for the distance function on a Riemannian manifold, how does this relate to geometric evolution equations? What can we then say about curvature, such as a comparison of distance implies a curvature comparison also (since on the small scale in geodesic coords, distance is like curvature at 2nd order)? Then can I apply this to say Ricci flow? What about MCF? How would this compare with extrinsic distance in this case?
*** Parabolic geometric equations
**** The equations
Let
\[
F: \Omega^2 (M, N) \times \Omega^1 (M, N) \times \Omega^0 (M, N) \times M
\]
with $\Omega^i (M, N)$ the $TN$-valued $i$ forms, e.g. if $u: M \to N$ then $Du: TM \to TN \in T^{\star}M \tensor TN$.
\[
\pd{t} u = F(D^2u, Du, u, x)
\]
where $u: M \times [0, T) \to N$. $N=\RR$ for scalar functions or could be the ambient space for a family of embeddings or symmetric two forms for the evolution of the metric. 
**** Normalised Flow
\[
\tilde{u}(x, \tau) = \lambda(t) u(x, t)
\]
with $\lambda$ the normalising factor and $\tau = \phi(t)$ some diffemorphism $\phi: [0, T) \to [0, \tilde{T})$. The normalised flow evolves according to the equation
\[
\pd{\tau} \tilde{u} = \frac{1}{\pd{t} \phi}\left(\pd{t} \lambda u + \lambda F(D^2u, Du, u, x) = \frac{1}{\pd{t} \phi} \left(\frac{\pd{t}\lambda}{\lambda} \tilde{u} + \lambda F(\frac{1}{\lambda} D^2\tilde{u}, \frac{1}{\lambda} D\tilde{u}, \frac{1}{\lambda} \tilde{u}, x)\right) .
\]
We'll want some kind of homogeneity in $F$ to bring the $\lambda$ out the front. So suppose $F$ is homogeneous of degree $(\alpha_2, \alpha_1, \alpha_0)$ with $\alpha_i$ the degree of homogeneity in $\Omega^i(M, N)$. Then we get
\[
\pd{\tau} \tilde{u} = frac{1}{\pd{t} \phi} \frac{\pd{t}\lambda}{\lambda} \tilde{u} + \frac{\lambda^{\alpha_2 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_0 + 1}}{\pd{t}\phi} F(D^2\tilde{u}, D\tilde{u}, \tilde{u}, x)
\]
which means we should choose
\[
\phi(t) = \int_0^t \lambda^{\alpha_2 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_0 + 1}
\]
to obtain
\[
\pd{\tau} \tilde{u} = F(D^2\tilde{u}, D\tilde{u}, \tilde{u}, x) + \frac{\pd{t}\lambda}{\lambda^{\alpha_2 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_0 + 2}} \tilde{u}.
\]
We'll need for the $t$ dependent bit to give some geometric quantity, such as total curvature. Possibly I could work out the sort of thing we'd need, but writing $\lambda$ as a function of the metric, or even $u$ iteself!

I'll call a Type I singularity one where the normalised flow has $\tilde{T}=\infty$ and a smooth limit (up to diffeomorphism invariance). In this case, although the flow becomes singular at time $T$, the way it does is somehow not pathalogical. For example in the CSF, closed curves must collapse, but for Type I singularities, that's all that goes wrong - no corners, cusps etc. Otherwise, the singularity is Type II. Either $\tilde{T} \ne \infty$ so that a cusp or corner has formed before the natural extinction time, or there is no (smooth) limit.

In the Type I case, we expect that $\pd{\tau}\tilde{u} \to 0$ so that the limit $\tilde{u}_{\infty}$ satisfies
\[
 F(D^2\tilde{u}_{\infty}, D\tilde{u}_{\infty}, \tilde{u}_{\infty}, x) + \frac{\pd{t}\lambda}{\lambda^{\alpha_2 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_0 + 2}} \tilde{u}_{\infty} = 0
\]

Then we have an elliptic problem to solve. i.e. we want to classify all such solutions. See also self shrinkers for MCF and solitons for Ricci flow. How do things like monotonicity (e.g. Huisken, Perelman?) relate to this? Doing all the above for MCF can be checked directly and it's all good!


**** Geometric quantities connecting with spatial variations
Now let $Z: N \times [0, T) \to G$ be some geometric quantity with $G$ probably $\RR$, but could be a vector bundle, for example the normal bundled $\nu M$ of an immersion and $G$ is the support function. I guess it could be all manner of things! Can the phrase "geometric" be interpereted as some sort of natural transformation? This way, for each $t$, it gives the geometric quantity for $u_t$ and so we could write $Z(u_t)$. That is, $Z$ shouldn't have explicit $t$-dependence and the way to compute $Z$ is the same for all $u_t$. Maybe not quite: $Z$ could have explicit time dependence as in mine and Ben's isoperimetric comparison work, but it should be the composition of a natural transformation and then adding in the $t$ dependence. In general this sort of thing will probably depend on the image $M_t = u_t(M)$. For instance, one can compute the arc-length of a curve in terms of the map $u_t$, but we think of this as some intrinsic geometric quantity of $M_t$. 

The evolution of $Z$ is
\[
\nabla_{\pd{t}} Z = DZ \dot \pd{t} u + \pd{t}Z = DZ \dot F + \pd{t} Z
\]

Now, spatial variations will produce something like $D^2u$, $Du$ etc. typically the gradient and laplacian. At a extrema, $D^2u$ is definite and $Du$ vanishes. Also $\nabla_{\pd{t}}Z$ will be decreasing (in some suitable sense). We then need to relate these temporal and spatial variations. That is, we'll need to relate $DZ \dot F$ with $D^2u$, $Du$ etc. In the MCF, $F$ is the Laplacian and so this is easy. For $\alpha$-CSF flows we needed spectral theory to apply $F$ to the spatial variations for our link. Maybe this works quite generally?

**** monotone quantities
Is there some sort of Noether like theorem for the existence of monotone quantities? How does this relate to all the above? If we can assert the existence of a monotone quantity, what does that tell us? Presumably, we'll also need some useful properties of such things. Again, I expect the quantity should be some sort of natural transformation, e.g. curvature. This would rule out something like taking $M(x, t) = t!$ and would also allow us to draw conclusions based on the properties of this natural transformation.

**** Standard evolution
I should write evolution equations for various common quantities, such as curvature. That is by choosing $Z=R$ above say, I only need to work out $DZ = DR$ once and then can apply it to any number of flows. Another important similar thing is to work out the dependence on the metric which all geometric quantities depend on. For example, let $Rm = Rm(g)$ be the Riemann curvature tensor for the metric $g$. What are $DRM$ and $D^2Rm$ where $Rm$ is thought of as a function of the metric. This will apply for all evolution equations/elliptic problems!

Can I make the metric stochastic and obtain a theory of quantum gravity?

Light should follow geodesics corresponding to parallel translation by Levi-Civita. These are also critical points of the energy which may be defined soley in terms of the metric. Massive particles however should follow different paths. This is because of the presence of various fields, like electromagnetic fields. Can I interepert this as a new connection like in the wave dark matter theory. Thus we would have an entirely geometric theory! Can we couple other dark matter theories via this mechanism? For instance can we do it with WIMP?
*** Mean curvature flow, solitons, Monge-Ampere, $\mathcal{F}$-Stability
- Is there some notion of stable soliton? How does this relate to $\mathcal{F}$-stability? The Monge-Ampere stuff links minimal hypersurfaces and soliton flows via a density. Is this density related to Huisken's density for self-shrinkers?
- Is there a correspondence between CMC hypersurfaces and some Monge-Ampere differential system? What about general mean curvature flows?
- Can I generalise these notions to arbitrary backgrounds and can I do the Monge-Ampere/soliton stuff in high co-dimension?
*** High Co-dim MCF and support functions
- The support function for high co-dim submanifolds can be the projection of the position vector field onto the normal bundle. How does this evolve? Can we apply the max principle?
- How does this relate to Mao Pei's Bernstein type estimate? There they look at the angle of a graph, which is just the support function anyway!

**** Notes
- Can I define a (weak) vector field on a manifold, such as $\grad d$? How does this relate to the Killing equation? If I define an almost-everywhere defined vector field $\grad d$, then I have a weak support function defined everywhere except the cut locus. So what does this give me then?
- Alencar and Frensel have a paper with a support funtion on constant curvature simply connected space forms: MR1173029. They define a vector field that does the job. Is this Killing?
- Given my vector field I can define a translation map almost everywhere.
- Can I solve (at least away from the cut locus) the Killing vector field equation? What about conformal- and pseudo-Killing fields? Is the obstruction to a global solution, cohomological?

*** Support function and $K+1$ flow on $\HH^3$
- $\HH^3$ is a Lie-group, but the metric is not left invariant. Do I still have a global Killing field, with respect to which I can define a support function? I guess $\HH^3$ has trivial tangent bundle so this is a good start! A canditate for the Killing field is something like $\sinh(d) d$.
- See Alancar and Frensel: MR1173029 for a canditate vector field.
*** Sphere theorem
Ben and Chris Hopper mention that the sphere theorem follows from comparison theorems for the distance function I think. They say you can't get to diffemorphism however. Maybe I can do it?

**** Notes
- Can we come up with an energy for ancient solutions? Something like the first derivative of curvature then look at minimisers? Are they ancient? We should also get some monotone quantity under the flow. Then we need to characterise the stationary solutions.
- Is Angenent Oval a soliton? 
- Compare Wilking's algebraic approach
- Check also Lei's way of doing things

*** Notes
$Z$ is some quantity like distance, non-collapsing, whatever. $\bar{Z}$ is the extrema over some range; for non-collaping $Z=Z(x,y)$, $\bar{Z}(x)=\sup_y Z(x,y)$. For $Z=d$, $\bar{Z}$ is the sup over $x$ and $y$. These will be over non-compact $M\times M - D$ with $D$ the diagonal. More generally, $Z$ may only be defined away from the cut locus. 

At the extrema, because of the vanishing of the first variation, the laplacian of $\bar{Z}$ turns into something like $\pd{x_i} \pm \pd{y_i}$. So a viscosity equation for $\laplace \bar{Z}$ relates to this other operator on $Z$. It might be worthwhile comparing the Hessians of $\bar{Z}$ and $Z$. The other important ingredient here is blowing up the diagonal to get a compact manifold.

     :TITLE: Isoperimetry and Viscosity Solutions in Geometric Evolution Equations
     :ABSTRACT: This talk will focus on studying geometric evolution equations through isoperimetric quantities. Such quantities are by their nature, extrema which makes them non-smooth in general. However, a degree of regularity remains and the appropriate tool here appears to be the use of viscosity equations. These have been well studied in the context of the closely related Hamilton-Jacobi equation. A particularly relevant technique for studying geometric evolution equations this way (and more generally), originating with Huisken in this context, is to extract as much as possible from the full hessian. I will illustrate this idea by describing joint work with Ben Andrews, extending Huisken's distance comparison theorem for the curve shortening flow in the plane. Time permitting, I will also discuss a sort of higher dimensional analogue - non-collapsing - for mean curvature flow and it's relationship to minimal and CMC surfaces, in particular leading to Brendle's recent proof of the Lawson conjecture for embedded tori in the three-sphere.
