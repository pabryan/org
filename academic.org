*** Review
Review Form

Place an 'X' next to a statement.

The paper:

----- is acceptable

----- needs revision

X---- should be rejected

Unfortunately, I think the paper should be rejected since the main result is essentially vacuous. What's more, the author seeks to find cases where $d/l$ is increasing for space curves. In general, we do not expect this to be true; embedded space curves can cross, at which point $d/l$ is $0$ and hence must have been decreasing at some point. The author does not give any conditions for when we might expect $d/l$ to be increasing, except for the obvious vaccuous condition:

In the paper, the computation in $\RR^3$ is much the same as Huisken's computation in $\RR^2$ on which the paper is based. This is a computation of the evolution of the ratio $d/l$ under the curve shortening flow where $d$ is the extrinsic distance in $\RR^3$ and $l$ the intrinsic distance on the curve. The computation gives, at minima $(p_0, q_0)$ of $d/l$ at time $t_0$,
\[
\frac{d}{dt} (d/l) \geq -|e_1+e_2|^2 +\langle e_1+e_2, w\rangle + \frac{d^2}{l^2} \left(\int_{\gamma_{t_0}} k ds_{t_0}\right)^2
\]
precisely as in Huisken's paper where $e_1,e_2$ are the unit tangents at $p_0$ and $q_0$ respectively and $w$ is the unit vector pointing from $p_0$ to $q_0$. The main theorem is then simply that if this is positive, then $d/l$ is increasing at $(p_0,q_0)$ at time $t_0$. As I say, a vaccuous statment.

In $2$ dimensions ($<w,e_1+e_2>$ and $|e_1+e_2|^2$) cancel and the result follows. In $3$ dimensions this no longer generally true and what's more, by Cauchy-Schwartz, these terms are negative. So $d/l$ will be positive precisely when the integral of curvature term dominates these two. The author does not give any indication of when this may or may not be true, nor say for instance that if it's true at time $t_0$ then it's true for $t>t_0$ which I think could be a useful result, but it's almost certainly not true!

Another part of the paper is devoted to studying the helix. The author shows, by direct computation and the assitance of matalb that when the pitch of the helix is small, the right hand side above is negative and that when it is sufficiently large it is positive. Thus there are cases where distance comparison may fail, but we already knew that. This is routine, elementary calculation and not suitable for publication in a research journal (unless the paper had something else worthwhile). In any event, the author shows that $d/l$ always increases for the helix (we discarded some terms in the inequality above), which again is by elementary, routine calculation.

The last two pages contain an interesting, rather simple result. That is, that space curves initially lying on the unit sphere, remain on the sphere of radius $\sqrt{t}$. By rescaling so that the curve remains on the unit sphere, and after suitably rescaling time, one obtains a solution of curve shortening flow on the sphere. This is quite simple to derive and although I was unaware of this result, it must surely be known as simple as it is. The author goes on to conlude a Grayson-type theorem, that the curve in $\RR^3$ collapses to a round point. The proof is by using the result for curves on $S^2$ that they either collapse to a round point or approach a geodesic (which is of course round). The problem here is that the author doesn't discuss whether the shrinking sphere can collapse before the corresponding curve on $S^2$ converges, which would mean that the space collapses to a non-round point. I think this is probably simple enough, but no mention of this possibility is made.

In any event, this latter result takes only 2 pages and is quite straightforward, again not publishable on it's own. However, personally I think this latter result has the most merit and could lead to some interesting research. I indicate a few quick thoughts in my comments for the author.


*** Comments for the author
The main theorems concerning $d/l$ improving at a minima are not particularly useful given they are essentially vaccuous. Theorem 2.2 for instance simply follows the same computation as Huisken's but in your case the required terms don't cancel, and by Cauchy-Schwartz are in fact negative when non-zero. Just stating that if they are positive then $d/l$ improves is not particularly useful, and I say is essentially vaccuous.

If you could modify $Z=d/l$ by adding some terms to obtain something that does improve, then perhaps this could be useful Keep in  mind, that having some quantity $Z$ improving is in itself not interesting. It is what you can then do with this that is important, e.g. by proving the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson theorem. With this in mind, I don't think your approach will produce any useful results because in general we know $d/l$ will not improve (for example by losing embeddedness) and because singularities can arise. These situations must somehow be handled or ruled out of consideration. There are however, perhaps some interesting questions in this direction: 

1. By comparing with some suitable comparison solution/function that you do understand, can you obtain results like the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson theorem or the Abresch-Langer classification of limiting shapes? Note again that such a theorem must be able to handle all the known phenoma of CSF for space curves. 

2. Alternatively, such a theorem could apply to a restricted class of space curves; for instance, it does apply to plane curves by Huisken's result. So, can you find an interesting class of curves for which the terms in Thm 2.2 are non-negative? For instance, does a bound on $\kappa/\tor$ (like in the Helix case) lead to improvement of $d/l$?

If you could answer question 2, then the helix example may be good to include in a future paper as illustation of this type of behaviour. On it's own, while an interesting example, it is not suitable for a research paper.

I did find the correspondence between spatial CSF starting on a sphere with CSF on the sphere interesting. I have a question about concluding a Gage-Hamilton-Grayson type result for this situation: could the shrinking sphere collapse before the corresponding flow on the unit sphere converges to a point/geodesic? If that happens, then you won't get a round point. 

The result for curves on spheres, though interesting, is probably not suitable for research publication. It is quite straightforward to prove and doesn't use any new techniques. Something that may be interesting would be to use the correspondence to study CSF on $S^2$ itself. Can you use the correspondence for instance, to prove the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson theorem on $S^2$? Can you use distance comparison in this case?

In another direction, suppose you have a family of surfaces in $\RR^3$ flowing by mean curvature flow (or some other geometric flow) and take a family of curves lying on the surface. These evolve along with the family of surfaces. Can you add a part tangential to the surface, but normal to the curve to obtain any useful geometric flow? Can you conclude anything useful about curve flows on surfaces from this point of view? Or, can you conclude anything useful about mean curvature flow of surfaces using the curve flow? What happens in higher dimensions?

This should just involve extra terms from the potential. These should give the Bakry-Emery tensor where the usual one has just the Ricci tensor. Our assumption is a bound on Bakry-Emery so it should be very similar. Do we compare with the sphere again, or some weighted model that satisfies equality. It would be good to know what the solutions are!

online to get bib type info. Then the paper can be renamed, a bib entry
can be created or downloaded, say from mathscinet or arxiv. I'd aso like this
to create an org-mode headline for my refs.org file. I don't want to do this
manually, though a bit of elisp should be able to iterate over each bib
entry (using reftex?) and update the refs.org file. I may also want to store
each bib entry in a seperate file and have refs.bib a concatenation of the lot
so that I don't have problems editing refs.bib from multiple places.

Also, one can approximate convex functions by smooth functions uniformally on compact sets. Does thie mean one can approximate Alexandrov spaces uniformally on compact sets by smooth manifolds?
