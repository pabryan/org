** SOMEDAY Research getting grants
I want mostly travel money 
Can I hire a car so we can all go on a road trip?
I need books
I want to do some sage or org-mode devel
I want to do teaching with sage-tex and/or org-mode with babel; i.e. interactive lectures so I can change the parameters of things like plots in real time

blackboard screen shots, scans of notebooks etc.

**** SOMEDAY org-mode create ref should create bib, mr/arxiv links
*** SOMEDAY pdf scraping tool to create bib entries and rename pdf files
This should open pdf's, get doi info and then look up the paper details
online to get bib type info. Then the paper can be renamed, a bib entry
can be created or downloaded, say from mathscinet or arxiv. I'd aso like this
to create an org-mode headline for my refs.org file. I don't want to do this
manually, though a bit of elisp should be able to iterate over each bib
entry (using reftex?) and update the refs.org file. I may also want to store
each bib entry in a seperate file and have refs.bib a concatenation of the lot
so that I don't have problems editing refs.bib from multiple places.

*** SOMEDAY Write script to auto download from mathscinet, arxiv etc.
The script should get mathscinet info, say a bib file and use the doi
info to automatically download the pdf file
Ideally this should be integrated into org-mode
See [[http://www.lhnr.de/index.html#code/localcopy][JabRef plugin]]
Also the URL format for MR lookup is

** New Research Project
Should I just make a script that takes the project name and does all this?
- [ ] Create project directory in [[~/working/academic/research]]
- [ ] Make master project.org file (includes notes, title other options like including my latex setup)
- [ ] Put under VC control
- [ ] Create empty bitbucket repository
- [ ] Clone local to bitbucket
