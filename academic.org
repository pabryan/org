***** Review
Review Form

Place an 'X' next to a statement.

The paper:

----- is acceptable

----- needs revision

X---- should be rejected

Unfortunately, I think the paper should be rejected since the main result is essentially vacuous. What's more, the author seeks to find cases where $d/l$ is increasing for space curves. In general, we do not expect this to be true; embedded space curves can cross, at which point $d/l$ is $0$ and hence must have been decreasing at some point. The author does not give any conditions for when we might expect $d/l$ to be increasing, except for the obvious vaccuous condition:

In the paper, the computation in $\RR^3$ is much the same as Huisken's computation in $\RR^2$ on which the paper is based. This is a computation of the evolution of the ratio $d/l$ under the curve shortening flow where $d$ is the extrinsic distance in $\RR^3$ and $l$ the intrinsic distance on the curve. The computation gives, at minima $(p_0, q_0)$ of $d/l$ at time $t_0$,
\[
\frac{d}{dt} (d/l) \geq -|e_1+e_2|^2 +\langle e_1+e_2, w\rangle + \frac{d^2}{l^2} \left(\int_{\gamma_{t_0}} k ds_{t_0}\right)^2
\]
precisely as in Huisken's paper where $e_1,e_2$ are the unit tangents at $p_0$ and $q_0$ respectively and $w$ is the unit vector pointing from $p_0$ to $q_0$. The main theorem is then simply that if this is positive, then $d/l$ is increasing at $(p_0,q_0)$ at time $t_0$. As I say, a vaccuous statment.

In $2$ dimensions ($<w,e_1+e_2>$ and $|e_1+e_2|^2$) cancel and the result follows. In $3$ dimensions this no longer generally true and what's more, by Cauchy-Schwartz, these terms are negative. So $d/l$ will be positive precisely when the integral of curvature term dominates these two. The author does not give any indication of when this may or may not be true, nor say for instance that if it's true at time $t_0$ then it's true for $t>t_0$ which I think could be a useful result, but it's almost certainly not true!

Another part of the paper is devoted to studying the helix. The author shows, by direct computation and the assitance of matalb that when the pitch of the helix is small, the right hand side above is negative and that when it is sufficiently large it is positive. Thus there are cases where distance comparison may fail, but we already knew that. This is routine, elementary calculation and not suitable for publication in a research journal (unless the paper had something else worthwhile). In any event, the author shows that $d/l$ always increases for the helix (we discarded some terms in the inequality above), which again is by elementary, routine calculation.

The last two pages contain an interesting, rather simple result. That is, that space curves initially lying on the unit sphere, remain on the sphere of radius $\sqrt{t}$. By rescaling so that the curve remains on the unit sphere, and after suitably rescaling time, one obtains a solution of curve shortening flow on the sphere. This is quite simple to derive and although I was unaware of this result, it must surely be known as simple as it is. The author goes on to conlude a Grayson-type theorem, that the curve in $\RR^3$ collapses to a round point. The proof is by using the result for curves on $S^2$ that they either collapse to a round point or approach a geodesic (which is of course round). The problem here is that the author doesn't discuss whether the shrinking sphere can collapse before the corresponding curve on $S^2$ converges, which would mean that the space collapses to a non-round point. I think this is probably simple enough, but no mention of this possibility is made.

In any event, this latter result takes only 2 pages and is quite straightforward, again not publishable on it's own. However, personally I think this latter result has the most merit and could lead to some interesting research. I indicate a few quick thoughts in my comments for the author.


***** Comments for the author
The main theorems concerning $d/l$ improving at a minima are not particularly useful given they are essentially vaccuous. Theorem 2.2 for instance simply follows the same computation as Huisken's but in your case the required terms don't cancel, and by Cauchy-Schwartz are in fact negative when non-zero. Just stating that if they are positive then $d/l$ improves is not particularly useful, and I say is essentially vaccuous.

If you could modify $Z=d/l$ by adding some terms to obtain something that does improve, then perhaps this could be useful Keep in  mind, that having some quantity $Z$ improving is in itself not interesting. It is what you can then do with this that is important, e.g. by proving the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson theorem. With this in mind, I don't think your approach will produce any useful results because in general we know $d/l$ will not improve (for example by losing embeddedness) and because singularities can arise. These situations must somehow be handled or ruled out of consideration. There are however, perhaps some interesting questions in this direction: 

1. By comparing with some suitable comparison solution/function that you do understand, can you obtain results like the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson theorem or the Abresch-Langer classification of limiting shapes? Note again that such a theorem must be able to handle all the known phenoma of CSF for space curves. 

2. Alternatively, such a theorem could apply to a restricted class of space curves; for instance, it does apply to plane curves by Huisken's result. So, can you find an interesting class of curves for which the terms in Thm 2.2 are non-negative? For instance, does a bound on $\kappa/\tor$ (like in the Helix case) lead to improvement of $d/l$?

If you could answer question 2, then the helix example may be good to include in a future paper as illustation of this type of behaviour. On it's own, while an interesting example, it is not suitable for a research paper.

I did find the correspondence between spatial CSF starting on a sphere with CSF on the sphere interesting. I have a question about concluding a Gage-Hamilton-Grayson type result for this situation: could the shrinking sphere collapse before the corresponding flow on the unit sphere converges to a point/geodesic? If that happens, then you won't get a round point. 

The result for curves on spheres, though interesting, is probably not suitable for research publication. It is quite straightforward to prove and doesn't use any new techniques. Something that may be interesting would be to use the correspondence to study CSF on $S^2$ itself. Can you use the correspondence for instance, to prove the Gage-Hamilton-Grayson theorem on $S^2$? Can you use distance comparison in this case?

In another direction, suppose you have a family of surfaces in $\RR^3$ flowing by mean curvature flow (or some other geometric flow) and take a family of curves lying on the surface. These evolve along with the family of surfaces. Can you add a part tangential to the surface, but normal to the curve to obtain any useful geometric flow? Can you conclude anything useful about curve flows on surfaces from this point of view? Or, can you conclude anything useful about mean curvature flow of surfaces using the curve flow? What happens in higher dimensions?

******** Review
This paper uses a nice idea to obtain a /lower/ curvature bound for the inverse Gauss curvature flow of a family of closed, convex hypersurfaces \(M_t\) in Euclidean space. I think the idea fits into a boader context, which is why I think it's "nice" (that and the fact that it's similar to one I've used myself - more on that later). So what's the idea? The idea is to consider the polar dual body (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahler_volume) \(K^{\circ}_t\) of the convex body \(K_t\) enclosed by \(M_t\). Under the Gauss curvature flow, the boundary of \(M^{\circ}_t\) of \(K^{\circ}_t\) satisfies a very similar evolution equation as does the original hypersurface. 

Around 20 years ago, in an influetntial paper, Tso used the support function (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_function) of a convex body to obtain an upper curvature bound for the Gauss curvature flow, which was then later used by Ben Andrews to prove both a Harnack inequality for the Gauss curvature flow of closed, convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space and to prove the convergence result that closed, convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space collapse to round points under the Gauss curvature flow, resolving a conjecture of Firey. Since the boundary of the dual body satisfies a similar evolution equation to the orginal hypersurface, much the same arguments yield an /upper/ bound for the Gauss curvature of the dual body under the flow. The key point now is that for every \(x \in M_t\), there is a point \(x^{\circ}\in M^{\circ}_t\) satisfying
\[
GK (x) \times GK(x^{\circ}) = 1
\]
where \(GK\) is the Gauss curvature. Thus an upper bound for \(GK^{\circ}\) translates to /lower/ bound for \(GK\). 

Ivaki obtains an upper bound for \(GK\) in the same way as Tso originally did, and a lower bound via the dual body as just described. So \(|GK|\) is uniformly bounded under the flow and standard parabolic boot-strapping arguments then show the hypersurface /expands/ under the inverse Gauss curvature flow, to a round sphere at infinity as $t\to\infty$.

Now, the reason I say this fits into a broader context is that the underlying idea is that one can directly obtain an upper curvature bound by studying the flow, but to obtain a lower bound, one needs to consider some sort of dual object. As an act of shameless self-promotion, I refer to my paper with Ben Andrews obtaining analogous results for the curve shortening flow of simple closed curves in the plane (http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0759). In that paper, we use the isoperimetric profile (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoperimetric_inequality) to obtain an upper curvature bound. To obtain a lower curvature bound we use the /exterior/ isoperimetric profile, which (and here's the point) is the isoperimetric profile of the complement (or /set-theoretic dual/) of the region enclosed by the curve. Similarly, Ben Andrews obtained an upper curvature bound for the Mean Curvature Flow by studying interior curvature balls, and a lower bound by studying exterior curvature balls (or interior curvature balls of the complement). Contrast these results to the Ricci flow where one can obtain lower curvature bounds via the maximum principle (http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3606). 

So it seems that for hypersurfaces, or more generally sub-manifolds, upper curvature bounds can be obtained directly by geometric methods, but lower bounds must be obtained from some sort of dual evolution equation.

For the hyperbolic barrier, concavity should fail when $b$ is too large. For how large, see D of 20/10 notes.

I have a lower bound for the numerator. To get an upper bound for the denominator for large x, take x around 1000 and add little bit. Then I just choose $b$ larger than the quotient and I should lose concavity.

- Is there something that can be deduced for optimal points/concavity by inequalities in the barrier sense? E.g. something like Bavard/Pansu and Sternberg/Zunbrum.
- Note that $\chordarcprofile^2$ is not concave for $\sphere^1$. So it's not worth trying to show that $\chordarcprofile^2(x) + k_0 x^2$ is concave when $\curvecurv \geq k_0$.
- It is true that convex curves have concave profiles however.
- I should note that we don't have square concavity.
- Is it true that convex curves have smooth profile?

****** Optimal chord/arc profile
Suppose $\bar\gamma$ is a (convex, symmetric in both axes, 4-vertex) `reference curve', i.e. $\bar\gamma = \{(x,u(x)),(x,-u(x)):\ -a\leq x\leq a\}$ where $u$ is concave and even, and the curvature $\bar\kappa$ is increasing on $(0,a)$.  Suppose further that $\bar\kappa^{\alpha}$ is a convex function on $(-a,a)$ (i.e. with respect to $x$, not arc length).

Suppose $\gamma$ is any other (convex, symmetric in both axes, 4-vertex (?)) curve, with chord-arc profile bounded below by that of $\bar\gamma$, and such that there is some interval on which equality is attained in this comparison, i.e. this is a subinterval of $\gamma$ of length $\ell$, and distance between endpoints $d$, and the arc of $\bar\gamma$ of length $\ell$ with minimal distance between endpoints also has this equal to $d$.   I think we can argue that the arc where this happens on the reference curve is symmetric (i.e. the points on the curve with $x\geq b$ for some $b$), and that after suitable translation and rotation the arc on $\gamma$ can be made to have endpoints coinciding and tangent directions at the endpoints also coinciding with the `reference' interval.  I think we can arrange (by symmetry of $\gamma$) that the interval of $\gamma$ is also symmetric after this rotation.

Then the integral of $|\kappa|^{1+\alpha}$ on this interval of $\gamma$ is no less than that on this interval of $\bar\gamma$.

Proof:  Let $y$ be the vertical component of position, parametrised on $[-\ell/2,\ell/2]$ by arc length.  By symmetry this is odd (for both curves).

Lemma:  $y\geq \bar y$.

This follows since by symmetry $y(s)-y(-s)$ is the distance between the endpoints of the curve on the interval $(-s/2,s/2)$ which by the chord-arc comparison must be no less than the distance between the endpoints of the reference curve.  We need to use the fact that the optimal intervals of the reference curve are these symmetric ones.

Lemma:  $f(r,p) = |r|^{1+\alpha}/(1-p^2)^{(1+\alpha)/2}$ is convex in $\{(r,p):\ -1\leq p\leq p\}$ if $\alpha\geq 1$.

Proof:  Direct computation of the Hessian.

Now observe:
$$
E = \int |\kappa|^{1+\alpha} ds = \int (|y''|/\sqrt{1-(y')^2})^{1+\alpha} ds = \int f(y'',y') ds.
$$
similarly
$$
\bar E = \int f(\bar y'',\bar y') ds.
$$
Therefore by convexity we have
$$
E = \int f(y'',y') ds
\geq \int f(\bar y'',\bar y') + Df_{\bar y'',\bar y'}((y-\bar y)'',(y-\bar y)') ds
= \bar E + (1+\alpha)\int (d/dx)^2(\bar k)^\alpha (y-\bar y) ds
$$
where the last step is a direct computation which uses integration by parts plus change of variable from $s$ to $x$.  Since $y\geq \bar y$, we have $E\geq \bar E$.

This proves the inequality we need.  The remaining problem is to remove the symmetry, etc. assumptions on $\gamma$.  The only place they are used at the moment is in deducing the inequality $y\geq \bar y$, and it might well be true that this might be true after symmetrising $y$ in the general case, if we use the chord-arc comparison some other way.

****** Actions on connections
******* Jet bundle approach
- Connection is a section of the jet bundle $J^1E \to E$.
  - http://mathoverflow.net/questions/106999/1-jet-bundle-on-vector-bundle-with-metric-connection
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehresmann_connection
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(fibred_manifold)#Connection_as_a_jet_bundle_section
- The action is quadratic on metrics and connections and their first derivatives. So a minimiser should be a section of some tensor product of symmetric 2-tensors, jet bundles and wherever the derivatives exist (e.g. $T^{\star} M \tensor S^2M$ for the metric). Then I just have some functional on their and find the Euler-Lagrange equation.

***** Notes
****** Rescaled flow
If $\exp: T_x N \to N$ is a diffeomorphism (in particular for Cartan-Hadamaard) manifolds, and we have a flow $M_t \subset N^{n+1}$, we can think of this as a flow $M_t \subset \RR^{n+1}$ with metric $\exp^{\star} g$. If the speed of the flow is geometric, then this pulls back to $\RR^{n+1}$. Now, I can define a rescaled flow so the volume remains constant. Then we can ensure by containment, that a point in the region enclosed by the $M_0$ remains in the region enclosed by the rescaled flow $\tilde{M}_t$ for all time and can do the polar dual!
****** Ambient Minkowski space
We would do it all in Minkowski space. I think the vector field gives the distance in Minkowski space to the totally geodesic hypersurface. We can then set up all our dual theory, radial functions and so forth in that ambient space, possibly with an intrinsic interpretation. In this setting we could maybe also do $\sphere^n$? Another interesting point is that we can do a normalised flow, by simultaneously expanding $M_t$ and $\HH^{n+1}$ by rescaling the ambient Minkowski space.

***** Notes
****** Model construction from Tangential Group Action
- Let $G$ act on $T_o M$ where $o \in M$ is some choice of origin. We require that $G$ fixes $o$ and probably that $G\subset GL^n$ or $G\subset O^n$ or $G\subset SO^n$.
- Choose a point $v \in T_o M$. How do we choose such a point? We can probably assume $v$ is unit length, particularly if $G\subset O^n$ or $SO^n$. Let $G(p)$ be the orbit of $p$.
- Define the model manifold 
  \[
  \tilde{M} = T_oM/G \times G(p),
  \]
  equipped with metric
  \[
  \tilde{\metric} = \bar{\metric} + f(r)^2 \metric_{\theta}
  \]
  for $\bar{\metric}$ the quotient metric on $T_oM/G$, $f(r)$ some positive function on $T_oM/G$ and $\metric_{\theta}$ some metric on $G(p)$. Here $r\in T_oM/G$ and $\theta \in G(p)$. How do we choose $\metric_{\theta}?$ This could just be the Euclidean metric on $T_oM$ restricted to $G(p)$ (assuming $G(p)$ is a submanifold which should be okay since $G$ acts effectively and transitively.
- We'll want to choose $f$ by some differential equation arising from the curvature. See for example, Kondo and Tanaka (2009). Then we can get some sort of curvature comparison from $M$ to $\tilde{M}$.
- More generally, we might collapse the orbit. Here we could take $H\subset G$ and use $H(p)$ rather than $G(p)$. 
- Compare this with the construction of radial comparison in Kondo and Tanaka (2009). There $G=SO^n$, so that $T_oM/G = [0,\infty)$. The orbit is reduced from $\sphere^n$ to $\sphere^1$, by considering an great circle on $\sphere^n$ which presumably corresponds to choosing $H$ to rotate about a fixed plane (then the great circle lies in that plane). $\metric_{\theta}$ is just the standard metric on $\sphere^1$. Thus I guess one way to proceed would be to choose the unit tangent sphere as source of points, let $G \subset SO^n$ and $H$ be the intersection of $G$ with the rotations fixing a plane (which plane?). Or $H$ could be any subgroup and we could take the metric on $H(p)$ to be the induced metric from the standard metric on $\sphere^n$. Here, since $H \subset G\subset SO^n$, the orbit is a subset of $\sphere^n$. Is it a submanifold?

***** Notes
I think there should be a result which says that for $a$ sufficiently small that the isoperimetric profile for $\tilde M$ is less than (some multiple of) the length of the shortest noncontractible closed geodesic in $M$, the isoperimetric profiles of $M$ and $\tilde M$ are the same.  The idea is as follows:  If the isoperimetric region has nontrivial topology and less than half the area, then since $\varphi'\geq 0$ the boundary is convex, and we can apply e.g. harmonic map heat flow from any boundary component to obtain a closed geodesic, so the total length of each boundary component must be at least as large as the length of the shortest closed geodesic.  If the region is disc type, then we can lift to a disc in $\tilde M$ and apply the isoperimetric inequality there.  I guess this means the argument should work dor $a$ such that the isoperimetric profile of $\tilde M$ is less than twice the length of the shortest geodesic.

So if we control the isoperimetric profile of $\tilde M$ and also get a lower bound on the length of the shortest geodesic, then we should be in business.

In the genus 1 case (where we are not rescaling), the length of the shortest nontrivial geodesic is nondecreasing (an easier version of the second variation argument we do in the paper).  So this case should work out OK.  In the higher genus case I don't see how to prove it yet, since the metric gets scaled down in the normalisation process which tries to shrink geodesics down.

I am wondering whether it might be possible to take into account the possible different topologies of isoperimetric regions in order to get estimates on the isoperimetric profile of $M$ instead of $\tilde M$:  For example out argument shows that the relevant isoperimetric regions are connected and have connected complement, so in the genus 1 case they are either disks, complements of discs, or annuli.   Maybe it is possible to argue separately for each of these cases?

******* NEXT Set up meshes
- use scipy for meshes (I think arrange does the trick)
- Should the mesh be passed in rather than dr or nsteps?
- I think at the very least, num_points (renamed from nsteps) would be better to pass than dr
- I should also be able to set and get the mesh and construct the object without a mesh and later set the mesh maybe. That is, I want to decouple the object from it's mesh so that the object exists independently of the mesh. If you want to actually compute, you need to have a mesh, but we could use the same object to compute with different meshes. Thus we'll need to raise an exception if the user tries to compute before the mesh is set. Probably the way to do this is to have separate instances for each different mesh. The big question is whether to store the mesh in the object or not. It's possible we could remove it entirely from the galaxy object and just have it return meshes with the solution, though perhaps an instance should be not only the galaxy with its various parameters, but also the mesh. Otherwise, it could become very impractical, since the calling application would have to handle all the meshes which is not something I want. Really, this is a question of defining a space time manifold (which includes a mesh) and solving the equations on this space time, which corresponds to finding the value of a bunch of functions on the mesh. Thus to solve this problem, is to create a spacetime manifold object and a differential equation object. Probably the differential equation object could be generic (i.e. a geometric diff eqn. but it needs to be implemented on the mesh).

******* NEXT Create specs (via tests!).
- make task lists for the specs, or perhaps the tasks just go in the "create clean code" version of ... with the tacit assumption that this implies tests are also written.
- The specs should not *ever* use the objects to test to create expected values! For instance, I have tests that create a galaxy object for testing and grab nsteps from the object to use in the expected values. This is not good! I should have an expected nsteps and use that to test the code generates the correct nsteps!

***** Notes
****** Spacetime
- This is the Minkowski manifold. I need to change spiral_galaxy to say wdm_spherically_symmetric_static_spiral_approx
- Spacetimes are
  - wdm_spherically_symmetric_static
  - wdm_spherically_symmetric_static_spiral_approx
  - wdm_spherically_symmetric_static_elliptical_approx
  - wdm_spherically_symmetric_static_dwarf_approx
- The spacetime consists of the manifold, which should essentially be a mesh and a metric of signature $(-+++)$. The metric may actually need to be computed first. It could be an initial value problem, where we have a three dimensional Riemannian manifold and use that as initial data to solve Einstein's equations. It could be a static space time where we solve based on parameters. On creation the metric should be computed. For these radial Minkowski metrics, this means calculating the potential.
- We should also have some way of computing gradients, divergence, Laplacian etc. from the metric. This is dependent on the manifold as well and hence the atlas. For the mesh, we shouldn't have to anything different say for meshes of different sizes as long as they are meshes for the same atlas. For instance, Euclidean and Minkowski space are easy to implement. Also putting say radial metrics on these spaces should also be easy to do! Some of these calculations wouldn't have to calculate say $Ric$ from first principles! For the sphere for example, we can hard code it. For rotationally symmetric metrics, we can come up with a nice, simple formula and use that. That is, this part is really dependent on the implementation of the metric, perhaps with a fall back implemented by the base manifold class that calculates from first principles. Thus the sphere implementation overrides the Ric method say and just returns the identity (or whatever it is!).
****** Simulations
- From the spacetime, we want to know things like the density, mass profile, rotation curves, run some test-particle simulations.
****** WDM 
******* Approx model
We solve for the metric and come up with various parameters such as $U, W$. These should be kept in memory since they can be used to calculate other quantities such as the density.
****** Numerics
- code like a/b/c is confusing (e.g. patternperiod/8/pi). It seems like a/b/c = a*c/b, but in fact it's a/(b*c).

  - transition maps! perhaps represented on boundaries rather than overlaps?
- frame cover extends cover

This should open pdf's, get doi info and then look up the paper details
online to get bib type info. Then the paper can be renamed, a bib entry
can be created or downloaded, say from mathscinet or arxiv. I'd aso like this
to create an org-mode headline for my refs.org file. I don't want to do this
manually, though a bit of elisp should be able to iterate over each bib
entry (using reftex?) and update the refs.org file. I may also want to store
each bib entry in a seperate file and have refs.bib a concatenation of the lot
so that I don't have problems editing refs.bib from multiple places.

I could also have author, title, date etc. in the properties drawer! This is redundant, but means I can search my org file on author etc.
No! Maybe I can use reftex and get it to take me to the entry in refs.org? I can certainly due this manually, using reftex to take me to the bib file which gives the ID which I can search for in the org file. Then I don't need to maintain duplicate info in the org and bib files and have all the power of reftex available.
I'd like to be able to use org-mode views to show papers/books by a given author or by subject. Maybe I can have some sort of hook that uses reftex to do the search and return a list of ID's which is then the filter for org-mode views.

*** Derivations
    SCHEDULED: <2014-05-05 Mon>
**** Notes
***** Motivation
To what extent do the derivations determine the smooth structure? That is, I want to consider differential ringed spaces and say that a smooth structure is such a ringed space. Or in other words, how canonical is a derivation on a ringed space? So, I have a locally ringed space that is locally isomorphic to the smooth functions on $\RR^n$ and this determines the smooth structure and is thus may be equipped with the standard derivations of partial differentiation. What about some sort of converse to this? In other words, what are the derivations on $C^{\infty}(\RR^n)$? Is there some way of characterising the standard derivation? Is it some sort of universal derivation? What are the properties that determine it?

One of my motivations is that any tensor derivation like a connection or Lie derivative, is determined by specifying it's action on smooth functions and on vector fields, then extending it by commuting with tensor products and contractions. What if you chose some other derivation? Does that mean anything? Consider also exotic spheres: do they have different derivations? They must!
***** Specifying derivations
On $\RR^n$, we probably want that the constant functions are precisely the zeros of the derivation. So, once we fix the "constants", what else need we do? Well, the next level would be polynomials. The resulting derivation is uniquely determined by specifying $d(x)$ and extending by linearity and the Leibniz rule to all polynomials. The usual choice is $d(x)$, but any choice will work here to give a unique derivation! 

Now, here's the interesting thing. How do I extend the derivation defined on polynomials to smooth functions? I want to approximate a smooth function $f$ by polynomials $p_{\epsilon}$ such that $\|f - p_{\epsilon}\| < \epsilon$ and take a limit. What difference does the topology make? There are many choices for topology here! Does for instance $C^k$ topology give $k$-th order approximations somehow?

Also, can I prove that the usual derivation is the unique derivation satisfying some sort of continuity property? That is, the usual derivation is obtained by taking a limit of difference quotients. Is there some reason why it should be this one? Is there some sort of dependence on parameters here? How do I characterise the usual derivation as a limit in an abstract way?

*** Distance viscosity and evolution equations and curvature
With a viscosity equation for the distance function on a Riemannian manifold, how does this relate to geometric evolution equations? What can we then say about curvature, such as a comparison of distance implies a curvature comparison also (since on the small scale in geodesic coords, distance is like curvature at 2nd order)? Then can I apply this to say Ricci flow? What about MCF? How would this compare with extrinsic distance in this case?
*** Parabolic geometric equations
**** The equations
Let
\[
F: \Omega^2 (M, N) \times \Omega^1 (M, N) \times \Omega^0 (M, N) \times M
\]
with $\Omega^i (M, N)$ the $TN$-valued $i$ forms, e.g. if $u: M \to N$ then $Du: TM \to TN \in T^{\star}M \tensor TN$.
\[
\pd{t} u = F(D^2u, Du, u, x)
\]
where $u: M \times [0, T) \to N$. $N=\RR$ for scalar functions or could be the ambient space for a family of embeddings or symmetric two forms for the evolution of the metric. 
**** Normalised Flow
\[
\tilde{u}(x, \tau) = \lambda(t) u(x, t)
\]
with $\lambda$ the normalising factor and $\tau = \phi(t)$ some diffemorphism $\phi: [0, T) \to [0, \tilde{T})$. The normalised flow evolves according to the equation
\[
\pd{\tau} \tilde{u} = \frac{1}{\pd{t} \phi}\left(\pd{t} \lambda u + \lambda F(D^2u, Du, u, x) = \frac{1}{\pd{t} \phi} \left(\frac{\pd{t}\lambda}{\lambda} \tilde{u} + \lambda F(\frac{1}{\lambda} D^2\tilde{u}, \frac{1}{\lambda} D\tilde{u}, \frac{1}{\lambda} \tilde{u}, x)\right) .
\]
We'll want some kind of homogeneity in $F$ to bring the $\lambda$ out the front. So suppose $F$ is homogeneous of degree $(\alpha_2, \alpha_1, \alpha_0)$ with $\alpha_i$ the degree of homogeneity in $\Omega^i(M, N)$. Then we get
\[
\pd{\tau} \tilde{u} = frac{1}{\pd{t} \phi} \frac{\pd{t}\lambda}{\lambda} \tilde{u} + \frac{\lambda^{\alpha_2 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_0 + 1}}{\pd{t}\phi} F(D^2\tilde{u}, D\tilde{u}, \tilde{u}, x)
\]
which means we should choose
\[
\phi(t) = \int_0^t \lambda^{\alpha_2 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_0 + 1}
\]
to obtain
\[
\pd{\tau} \tilde{u} = F(D^2\tilde{u}, D\tilde{u}, \tilde{u}, x) + \frac{\pd{t}\lambda}{\lambda^{\alpha_2 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_0 + 2}} \tilde{u}.
\]
We'll need for the $t$ dependent bit to give some geometric quantity, such as total curvature. Possibly I could work out the sort of thing we'd need, but writing $\lambda$ as a function of the metric, or even $u$ iteself!

I'll call a Type I singularity one where the normalised flow has $\tilde{T}=\infty$ and a smooth limit (up to diffeomorphism invariance). In this case, although the flow becomes singular at time $T$, the way it does is somehow not pathalogical. For example in the CSF, closed curves must collapse, but for Type I singularities, that's all that goes wrong - no corners, cusps etc. Otherwise, the singularity is Type II. Either $\tilde{T} \ne \infty$ so that a cusp or corner has formed before the natural extinction time, or there is no (smooth) limit.

In the Type I case, we expect that $\pd{\tau}\tilde{u} \to 0$ so that the limit $\tilde{u}_{\infty}$ satisfies
\[
 F(D^2\tilde{u}_{\infty}, D\tilde{u}_{\infty}, \tilde{u}_{\infty}, x) + \frac{\pd{t}\lambda}{\lambda^{\alpha_2 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_0 + 2}} \tilde{u}_{\infty} = 0
\]

Then we have an elliptic problem to solve. i.e. we want to classify all such solutions. See also self shrinkers for MCF and solitons for Ricci flow. How do things like monotonicity (e.g. Huisken, Perelman?) relate to this? Doing all the above for MCF can be checked directly and it's all good!


**** Geometric quantities connecting with spatial variations
Now let $Z: N \times [0, T) \to G$ be some geometric quantity with $G$ probably $\RR$, but could be a vector bundle, for example the normal bundled $\nu M$ of an immersion and $G$ is the support function. I guess it could be all manner of things! Can the phrase "geometric" be interpereted as some sort of natural transformation? This way, for each $t$, it gives the geometric quantity for $u_t$ and so we could write $Z(u_t)$. That is, $Z$ shouldn't have explicit $t$-dependence and the way to compute $Z$ is the same for all $u_t$. Maybe not quite: $Z$ could have explicit time dependence as in mine and Ben's isoperimetric comparison work, but it should be the composition of a natural transformation and then adding in the $t$ dependence. In general this sort of thing will probably depend on the image $M_t = u_t(M)$. For instance, one can compute the arc-length of a curve in terms of the map $u_t$, but we think of this as some intrinsic geometric quantity of $M_t$. 

The evolution of $Z$ is
\[
\nabla_{\pd{t}} Z = DZ \dot \pd{t} u + \pd{t}Z = DZ \dot F + \pd{t} Z
\]

Now, spatial variations will produce something like $D^2u$, $Du$ etc. typically the gradient and laplacian. At a extrema, $D^2u$ is definite and $Du$ vanishes. Also $\nabla_{\pd{t}}Z$ will be decreasing (in some suitable sense). We then need to relate these temporal and spatial variations. That is, we'll need to relate $DZ \dot F$ with $D^2u$, $Du$ etc. In the MCF, $F$ is the Laplacian and so this is easy. For $\alpha$-CSF flows we needed spectral theory to apply $F$ to the spatial variations for our link. Maybe this works quite generally?

**** monotone quantities
Is there some sort of Noether like theorem for the existence of monotone quantities? How does this relate to all the above? If we can assert the existence of a monotone quantity, what does that tell us? Presumably, we'll also need some useful properties of such things. Again, I expect the quantity should be some sort of natural transformation, e.g. curvature. This would rule out something like taking $M(x, t) = t!$ and would also allow us to draw conclusions based on the properties of this natural transformation.

**** Standard evolution
I should write evolution equations for various common quantities, such as curvature. That is by choosing $Z=R$ above say, I only need to work out $DZ = DR$ once and then can apply it to any number of flows. Another important similar thing is to work out the dependence on the metric which all geometric quantities depend on. For example, let $Rm = Rm(g)$ be the Riemann curvature tensor for the metric $g$. What are $DRM$ and $D^2Rm$ where $Rm$ is thought of as a function of the metric. This will apply for all evolution equations/elliptic problems!
*** Quantum Gravity
Can I make the metric stochastic and obtain a theory of quantum gravity?
*** General Relativity
Light should follow geodesics corresponding to parallel translation by Levi-Civita. These are also critical points of the energy which may be defined soley in terms of the metric. Massive particles however should follow different paths. This is because of the presence of various fields, like electromagnetic fields. Can I interepert this as a new connection like in the wave dark matter theory. Thus we would have an entirely geometric theory! Can we couple other dark matter theories via this mechanism? For instance can we do it with WIMP?
*** Mean curvature flow, solitons, Monge-Ampere, $\mathcal{F}$-Stability
- Is there some notion of stable soliton? How does this relate to $\mathcal{F}$-stability? The Monge-Ampere stuff links minimal hypersurfaces and soliton flows via a density. Is this density related to Huisken's density for self-shrinkers?
- Is there a correspondence between CMC hypersurfaces and some Monge-Ampere differential system? What about general mean curvature flows?
- Can I generalise these notions to arbitrary backgrounds and can I do the Monge-Ampere/soliton stuff in high co-dimension?
*** High Co-dim MCF and support functions
- The support function for high co-dim submanifolds can be the projection of the position vector field onto the normal bundle. How does this evolve? Can we apply the max principle?
- How does this relate to Mao Pei's Bernstein type estimate? There they look at the angle of a graph, which is just the support function anyway!

**** Notes
- Can I define a (weak) vector field on a manifold, such as $\grad d$? How does this relate to the Killing equation? If I define an almost-everywhere defined vector field $\grad d$, then I have a weak support function defined everywhere except the cut locus. So what does this give me then?
- Alencar and Frensel have a paper with a support funtion on constant curvature simply connected space forms: MR1173029. They define a vector field that does the job. Is this Killing?
- Given my vector field I can define a translation map almost everywhere.
- Can I solve (at least away from the cut locus) the Killing vector field equation? What about conformal- and pseudo-Killing fields? Is the obstruction to a global solution, cohomological?

*** Support function and $K+1$ flow on $\HH^3$
- $\HH^3$ is a Lie-group, but the metric is not left invariant. Do I still have a global Killing field, with respect to which I can define a support function? I guess $\HH^3$ has trivial tangent bundle so this is a good start! A canditate for the Killing field is something like $\sinh(d) d$.
- See Alancar and Frensel: MR1173029 for a canditate vector field.

**** Notes
Is there a consistent (say providing ZFC is consistent) set theory without the empty set? That is, a non-trivial theory implies that there is at least one set. Does there have to be a minimum set under inclusion? Usually we want the empty set as a start point to bootstrap from there, creating say $1, 2, 3, \cdots$ and ordinal numbers. But, does there have to be a starting point?

**** Notes
I want to study Gauss maps $(E,X,\pi) \to (\RR^k\times X, X, \pi)$, in particular relating the number of trivialisations required to cover $E$ and the how big $k$ is. I also want to use this to integrate tensors component-by-component with respect to the Gauss map. This also relates to Grassmanians. What sort of cohomology theory is involved here?

*** Ideas
**** The use of coordinates in DG.
We should take a "structural" or algebraic approach. Coords and frames are useful computational places, and also are essential in the definition. However, many calculations follow say be commuting derivatives etc. and don't need a local coordinate calculation once we already know we have geometrically invariant objects, we can just calculate with the algebraic structure, which exposes what's going on better rather than just some convenient cancellation in orthonormal coordinates. 

However, some things like the action in WDM and general relativity may be defined purely in coords, but yield invariant quantities. How does that happen? Can it be expressed invariantly from the start? In continuum mechanics, we have a non-invariant derivation (i.e. conservation of momentum by integrating the velocity vector field component by component) to obtain an invariant differential equation. How does that happen? The derivation depends on the choice of a Gauss map.

*** Notes
$Z$ is some quantity like distance, non-collapsing, whatever. $\bar{Z}$ is the extrema over some range; for non-collaping $Z=Z(x,y)$, $\bar{Z}(x)=\sup_y Z(x,y)$. For $Z=d$, $\bar{Z}$ is the sup over $x$ and $y$. These will be over non-compact $M\times M - D$ with $D$ the diagonal. More generally, $Z$ may only be defined away from the cut locus. 

At the extrema, because of the vanishing of the first variation, the laplacian of $\bar{Z}$ turns into something like $\pd{x_i} \pm \pd{y_i}$. So a viscosity equation for $\laplace \bar{Z}$ relates to this other operator on $Z$. It might be worthwhile comparing the Hessians of $\bar{Z}$ and $Z$. The other important ingredient here is blowing up the diagonal to get a compact manifold.

     :TITLE: Isoperimetry and Viscosity Solutions in Geometric Evolution Equations
     :ABSTRACT: This talk will focus on studying geometric evolution equations through isoperimetric quantities. Such quantities are by their nature, extrema which makes them non-smooth in general. However, a degree of regularity remains and the appropriate tool here appears to be the use of viscosity equations. These have been well studied in the context of the closely related Hamilton-Jacobi equation. A particularly relevant technique for studying geometric evolution equations this way (and more generally), originating with Huisken in this context, is to extract as much as possible from the full hessian. I will illustrate this idea by describing joint work with Ben Andrews, extending Huisken's distance comparison theorem for the curve shortening flow in the plane. Time permitting, I will also discuss a sort of higher dimensional analogue - non-collapsing - for mean curvature flow and it's relationship to minimal and CMC surfaces, in particular leading to Brendle's recent proof of the Lawson conjecture for embedded tori in the three-sphere.

- Title: Isoperimetric comparisons and geometric flows
- Abstract: The study of isoperimetric inequalities has a long history, it's humble beginnings in Ancient Greek mathematics belying a deep and rich theory. A major tool in the study of the isoperimetric profile is the Calculus of Variations. Variational arguments lead to weak differential inequalities for the isoperimetric profile, which allows analytical tools such as the maximum principle to be employed. Of central importance here is the connection with curvature, which is intimately connected with the topology of isoperimetric regions. I will survey some of the results in this direction, paying particular attention to the interplay of the isoperimetric profile and curvature flows which is the focus of my current research.

- WF: Student groups lead discussion. Not everyone in the group has to present. Some can just be involved in the preparation.
- MWF: A student takes minutes (it rotates). 
- Need course discussion/blog on Google+ or Facebook.
- Class time can include working out time too.
