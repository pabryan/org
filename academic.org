gtd. Have some sort of notes folder for each project where I can dump
blackboard screen shots, scans of notebooks etc.

**** NEXT org-mode create ref should create bib, mr/arxiv links
*** NEXT pdf scraping tool to create bib entries and rename pdf files
This should open pdf's, get doi info and then look up the paper details
online to get bib type info. Then the paper can be renamed, a bib entry
can be created or downloaded, say from mathscinet or arxiv. I'd aso like this
to create an org-mode headline for my refs.org file. I don't want to do this
manually, though a bit of elisp should be able to iterate over each bib
entry (using reftex?) and update the refs.org file. I may also want to store
each bib entry in a seperate file and have refs.bib a concatenation of the lot
so that I don't have problems editing refs.bib from multiple places.

*** TODO Write script to auto download from mathscinet, arxiv etc.
The script should get mathscinet info, say a bib file and use the doi
info to automatically download the pdf file
Ideally this should be integrated into org-mode
See [[http://www.lhnr.de/index.html#code/localcopy][JabRef plugin]]
Also the URL format for MR lookup is
http://www.ams.org/mrlookup?au=yau%20and%20li&year=1986&format=mrcit
with various other fields allowed, but not MR number!

** New Research Project
Should I just make a script that takes the project name and does all this?
- [ ] Create project directory in [[~/working/academic/research]]
- [ ] Make master project.org file (includes notes, title other options like including my latex setup)
- [ ] Put under VC control
- [ ] Create empty bitbucket repository
- [ ] Clone local to bitbucket
