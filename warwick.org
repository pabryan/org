- Abstract:
  In 2010, Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi-White conjectured that the entropy of any closed surface in R^3 is at least that of the self-shrinking two-sphere.  I will explain joint work with X. Zhou where we interpret this conjecture as a parabolic version of the Willmore problem and give a min-max proof of (most cases) of their conjecture.
