* Next Action
** Enrol in emergency warning systems		      :COMPUTER:TABLET:PHONE:
** Winter text books						   :COMPUTER:
** math150a student 						   :COMPUTER:
** UCSD publishing meeting					   :COMPUTER:
** Schedule tasks						   :COMPUTER:
Need to mind map first to determine tasks though!
** Organise research projects 					   :COMPUTER:
Need to make project version controls and org files linked to from gtd. Have some sore of notes folder for each project where I can dump blackboard screen shots, scans of notebooks etc.
*** Ricci isoperimetric comparison
*** Pipe flows
*** $\alpha$ curve flows
*** dist. comp. on surfaces
*** CMC stability
*** CSF iso profile on surfaces
*** Vector symmetric polynomials
*** k-graphs, free constructions
*** iso profile comparison Kahler manifolds
*** CSF for networks
*** Perelman pseudo-locality
*** Degenerate neck-pinches
*** Ricci flow on warped products

** Research paper notebooks					   :COMPUTER:
** Configure Mercurial 
e.g. ignore emacs back files

* Someday/maybe

** Computing
*** org-mode
**** VC it!
**** Projects directory scanned by cron and automatically added to GTD
Since gtd will be on dropbox, I'll need to worry about clashes in syncing.
*** Integrated panel (widget?) based O/S

e.g. panels display some content and take input/output have events, hooks etc.

*** Collate junk code

*** Learn how to do accented characters etc. in text files
** Maths
*** sage
*** ANUGA
*** Vector symmetric polynomials
*** Higher category theory - coloured graphs

*** Comparison for dist fn.
Can I solve the diff. ineq. in general to get some useful comparison theory for distance function. compare space forms of const. curve $k$, where we define $f_k(d)\grad d$.
** Applied research
*** Astrophysics research
*** General relativity

** Exposition
*** Get involved in social networking for research etc.
*** Blog about things like bare foot walking
*** Produce lecture blogs
*** General public articles on maths
    
* Mind Sweep
** Track health, exercise, diet etc.
