Need to mind map first to determine tasks though!
** Organise research projects 					   :COMPUTER:
Need to make project version controls and org files linked to from gtd. Have some sore of notes folder for each project where I can dump blackboard screen shots, scans of notebooks etc.
*** Ricci isoperimetric comparison

* Teaching
** Math150A Fall 2012
*** math150a lecture log					   :COMPUTER:
*** math150a notes						   :COMPUTER:
    circle arc-len parametrisations
    curve len independent of parametrisation

*** Assign math150a homework					   :COMPUTER:

*** In lecture log, talk about area, Green's thm
* Someday/maybe

** Computing
*** org-mode
**** VC it!
**** Projects directory scanned by cron and automatically added to GTD
     Since gtd will be on dropbox, I'll need to worry about clashes in syncing.
**** TODO's 
     These make up the next action list which I need to find out how to check and to populate from various different files
**** Scheduling
**** Dependencies
     e.g. for exporting to Gantt charts
**** Replace mendeley
**** Integrate note taking apps, screen and web clippers
*** Integrated panel (widget?) based O/S

e.g. panels display some content and take input/output have events, hooks etc.

*** Collate junk code

*** Learn how to do accented characters etc. in text files
*** Note taking app for android
    should have a navigation area and a writing area, some sort of zooming
*** Research mobile org voice input
** Maths
*** sage
*** ANUGA
*** Vector symmetric polynomials
*** Higher category theory - coloured graphs

*** Comparison for dist fn.
Can I solve the diff. ineq. in general to get some useful comparison theory for distance function. compare space forms of const. curve $k$, where we define $f_k(d)\grad d$.
** Applied research
*** Astrophysics research
*** General relativity

** Exposition
*** Get involved in social networking for research etc.
*** Blog about things like bare foot walking
*** Produce lecture blogs
*** General public articles on maths
    
** Misc
*** Speed reading
