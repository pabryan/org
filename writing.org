These guys train up their Qi. They root to the earth. Perhaps at some battle a (big?) guy defends the monastary while the others get away and root himself deep into the earth, literally. I might also have this daoist guy who is really old and who casually walks very fast without seeming to put any effort into it. They do big jumps, train iron shirt and so on. I should have hand seals and chanting in it also.
